I then created a list called `expected` that held the proper name endings. If a street name ending did not exist in my expected list, it was replaced by its associated value from the `mapping` dictionary. I used a regular expression to extract the street name ending for this comparison. I choose to ignore street endings that were numeric because there are valid streets that end in a number, for example 'Highway 287'.

    "Out of the 720409 entries in total, Andrew Matheny contributed 594531, which is approximately 82.53% of the entire dataset. If we take the contributions from the top 5 contributors, we see that more than 88% of our data was collected from 5 sources, one of which has the name 'fixbot'. Considering a majority of our dataset is from a handful of users, it would be beneficial if more users were contributing towards a more complete and accurate OpenStreetMap data set. Limiting the data to a handful of users can lead to more inaccuracies in the dataset. If one of these predominate users continuously added erroneous data, then a large percentage of the dataset would reflect these inaccuracies. Having a more diversified set of users could help eliminate this issue. More users entering and editing data that was incorrect would mean the overall dataset was more accurate. Also having more users contributing would mean a wider range of streets and places would be included. Additional users, each contributing a small amount, would lead to less work for everyone and more attention could be spent on accuracy and minute details. \n",

    " The challenge is finding enough people who are willing to do stuff for the advancement of technology and the greater whole, without being financially compensated.  One idea I had for this would be to try to involve the local community colleges or universities. When I was attending my local community college, I had a professor who was very involved in helping the community, while simultaneously providing her students with opportunities to get hands on experience with web development and general IT exposure. This type of collaborative effort from a local community college could be exactly what the OpenStreetMap project could benefit from. If some entry level computer science courses had their students register for the OSM project and contribute to the data around the areas they live, work, and go to school, it would further the OSM project and provide more accurate data. It could be beneficial for the students as well by having real life exposure to some coding assignments. The data cleaning aspect of any category I refined in my project would be perfect coding projects or assignments for entry level computer science students. I’m sure most professors could find a way to integrate some aspect of the OSM project into their curriculum while simultaneously contributing to the OSM project. I know there would be challenges in finding local colleges and universities to participate; as well as challenges integrating such a project into a normal curriculum, but it could be mutually beneficial to all parties involved.  \n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "After spending a decent amount of time looking through and refining this dataset, I can see there is quite a bit of work to be done. There are numerous inconsistencies for both categories and the formatting of data in these categories. Numerous fields exist for something a simple as a zipcode: zip_left, zip_right, and addr:postcode just to name a few. Not to mention inconsistencies within these categories, such as variations in units used. It was interesting to dig into some of this data and see categories like the number of fast food restaurants, with my favorite, Whataburger coming out on top. It was also not a surprise to me to see very little in the means of tourism. The top two from this category were hotels and motels. Saginaw is a fast-growing suburb of Fort Worth, but it is still small in the grand scheme of things. "
